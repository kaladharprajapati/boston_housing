# Predicting Boston house prices
The Boston housing market is highly competitive, and we want to be the best real estate agents in the area. To compete with our peers, we decide to leverage a few basic machine learning concepts to assist us and a client with finding the best selling price for their home. Luckily, weâ€™ve come across the Boston Housing dataset which contains aggregated data on various features for houses in Greater Boston communities, including the median value of homes for each of those areas. Our task is to build an optimal model based on a statistical analysis with the tools available. This model will then be used to estimate the best selling price for our clients' homes.

In the project, we will apply basic machine learning concepts on data collected for housing prices in the Boston, Massachusetts area to predict the selling price of a new home. We will first explore the data to obtain important features and descriptive statistics about the dataset. Next, we will properly split the data into testing and training subsets, and determine a suitable performance metric for this problem. We will then analyze performance graphs for a learning algorithm with varying parameters and training set sizes. This will enable us to pick the optimal model that best generalizes for unseen data. Finally, we will test this optimal model on a new sample and compare the predicted selling price to our statistics.
